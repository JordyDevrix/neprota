## A Dutch syntax scripting language made completely in Python
I started this little project to gain more knowledge about python and how interpreted languages work.
At first, I started this project as a joke, but I went on and actually created a simple yet very cool interpreter
that you can use to create small scripts in Neprota.

This repository comes with a file which you can use in [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) to get the correct syntax colors and it will soon be 
equipped with a full guide as to how scripting in Neprota works. This project is far from finish though
and I expect to make some major updates with loads of new features.

**_note: It can be very usefull to know some words in Dutch_**
